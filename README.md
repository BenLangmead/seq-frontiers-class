### RNA sequencing data analysis

* Surveys (everyone should read these -- don't pick one of these to present in class):
** [RNA-Seq: a revolutionary tool for transcriptomics](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v10/n1/full/nrg2484.html) by Wang, Gerstein, Snyder
** [Computational methods for transcriptome annotation and quantification using RNA-seq](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v8/n6/pdf/nmeth.1613.pdf) by Garber, Grabherr, Guttman and Trapnell
** [From RNA-seq reads to differential expression results](http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/gb-2010-11-12-220.pdf) by Oshlack, Robinson, Young

** Spliced alignment
*** [MapSplice: Accurate mapping of RNA-seq reads for splice junction discovery](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/18/e178.full.pdf) by Wang et al
*** [TopHat: discovering splice junctions with RNA-seq](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/9/1105.full.pdf) by Trapnell, Pachter, Salzberg
